# Trading Algorithm Project

This project is a Python-based trading algorithm designed to analyze financial data and make trading decisions using pattern recognition, structure recognition, and mathematical techniques.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main entry point of the trading algorithm. This script integrates various components to execute the trading strategy.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing the Python packages required to run the algorithm.

## Features

- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies patterns in financial data to forecast market movements.
- **Structure Recognition**: Analyzes market structure to understand market trends and behaviors.
- **Mathematical Analysis**: Applies mathematical models and calculations to make informed trading decisions.
